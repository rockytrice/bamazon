# bamazon
 bamazon is a Amazon-like storefront built using MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
The  database is populated with around 12 different products.
Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Including the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
The app should then prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

 Once the customer has placed the order, the  application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
 If not, the app should log a phrase like `Insufficient quantity!`, and then prevent the order from going through.
 To run on your machine you must clone the repo to your machine and install mysql npm package and inquirer npm package
